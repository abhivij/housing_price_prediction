üìà **Best Public Score (RMSE on log prices) : 0.11756**
- Achieved using a voting ensemble combining **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost** regression pipelines.
- Tuned hyperparameters for each individual model pipeline using **Optuna**.
- The public score was computed on the test set without access to ground-truth sales prices.
- ‚ö†Ô∏èNote: Several top submissions in the competition used an external dataset that closely matched the test set, leading to near-perfect RMSE scores (~0.00044).
